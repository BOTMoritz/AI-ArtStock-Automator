# AI ArtStock Automator

## Overview
AI ArtStock Automator is a state-of-the-art automation system designed to create and sell AI-generated images on platforms like AdobeStock. This project harnesses the power of Midjourney v6 to generate unique, high-quality images and automates their upload to stock websites, showcasing an innovative blend of art and technology.

## Key Features
- **Automated Image Generation:** Utilizes Midjourney v6 for generating visually stunning and diverse images.
- **Advanced Image Processing:** Incorporates techniques for image scaling and enhancement to ensure top quality.
- **Automated Uploading:** Streamlines the process of uploading images to various stock photography platforms.
- **Efficient Web Scraping:** Implements Selenium and Python for scraping and interacting with web platforms.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** For scripting the automation and processing logic.
- **Selenium:** To automate web browser interactions, particularly with Discord.
- **OpenAI's ChatGPT:** Leveraged for generating creative prompts for Midjourney v6.
- **PIL (Python Imaging Library):** Used for image manipulation and processing tasks.

## My Expertise and Contributions
- **Automation Design:** Developed the core automation logic to streamline the image generation and uploading process.
- **Creative Prompt Generation:** Utilized my skills in working with ChatGPT to create effective prompts for image generation.
- **Image Processing:** Implemented advanced image processing techniques to enhance the visual quality of generated images.
- **Web Scraping:** Employed Selenium for efficient web scraping, demonstrating my proficiency in extracting and utilizing web data.

## Project Setup and Execution

The AI ArtStock Automator is designed with a sophisticated automation workflow, integrating several advanced technologies and programming practices. The setup and execution process of the project highlights my expertise in Python programming, web automation using Selenium, and AI-driven image generation using OpenAI's ChatGPT and Midjourney v6.

### Key Components:

- **Web Automation:**
  Utilizing Selenium, the project automates interactions with web browsers, specifically targeting Discord to access Midjourney v6. This involves managing browser sessions, navigating through web pages, and simulating human-like interactions to generate image prompts.

- **Image Prompt Generation:**
  The system dynamically selects image themes from a predefined list, leveraging OpenAI's ChatGPT to create engaging and unique prompts. These prompts are used to instruct Midjourney v6 in generating creative and high-quality images.

- **Image Processing:**
  Post-generation, images are processed for quality enhancement. This involves downloading the images using web scraping techniques, followed by image resizing and quality enhancement using Python's PIL library.

- **Workflow Automation:**
  The entire process, from selecting image themes, generating prompts, processing images, to organizing them in designated folders, is automated. This demonstrates a robust implementation of script-based automation to handle repetitive tasks efficiently.

- **File Management:**
  The project employs advanced file handling techniques in Python. It involves managing JSON data for prompt storage, handling image files, and organizing them into structured directories for easy access and management.

### Execution Flow:

1. **Initialization:**
   Setting up the Selenium WebDriver with specific configurations to interact with the Discord channel where Midjourney operates.

2. **Prompt Generation and Image Creation:**
   Automated selection of image themes and generation of creative prompts using ChatGPT. These prompts are then fed into Midjourney through Discord to create images.

3. **Image Processing and Management:**
   Images are downloaded, resized, and enhanced for quality. They are then systematically organized in folders, demonstrating efficient file management.

4. **Continuous Operation:**
   The system is designed to run in a loop, continuously generating and processing images, showcasing my ability to implement long-running automated processes.

This setup exemplifies a comprehensive understanding and application of Python for automation, AI integration for creative processes, and effective management of digital assets, highlighting my capabilities in creating advanced automated systems.
